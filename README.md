# Flight-Price-Prediction-Data-Science-Projects
Flight Price Prediction is a machine learning-based project that predicts the cost of a flight based on the user's desired travel details. The project uses a variety of features, such as the source airport, destination airport, date of Journey, and number of stops, to train a model that can predict the future price of a flight.
## Problem Statement
Flight ticket prices can be unpredictable, and it can be difficult to know what to expect when booking a flight. This project aims to predict the price of a flight based on a variety of factors, such as the source airport, destination airport, date of Journey, and number of stops.
## Solution Approach
The project uses a machine learning model to predict the price of a flight. The model is trained on a dataset of historical flight prices, and it uses the features in the dataset to predict the price of a flight.
## Observations
The project found that the following factors are most important in predicting the price of a flight:

* The SOurce airport
* The destination airport
* The date of Journey
* The number of stops
* The airline
* The time of day
